# About GUI

I didn't think I would write about GUI. 

I mean, this is possibly one of the simplest things in modern programming: you have unlimited amount of frameworks to chose, React, Flutter, or Qt. Probably more than what one person would ever need. 

I was happy using these frameworks, because why not. They were developed by the largest companies in the world, and they have done a lot of research of finding the optimal solutions.
